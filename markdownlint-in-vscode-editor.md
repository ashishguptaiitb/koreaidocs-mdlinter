# Use MD linting in docs

Keep the Markdown clean using a linter!

## Install

Install the extension [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint).

## Use

The extension automatically loads and checks any files that you open in VSCode Editor. See the issues in the **View** > **Problems** or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `M`.

**Note**: Writers on the team don't have to do any configuration. I'll take care of it.
